    "## What is Numba?\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is a **just-in-time**, **type-specializing**, **function compiler** for accelerating **numerically-focused** Python for either a CPU or GPU. That's a long list, so let's break down those terms:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **function compiler**: Numba compiles Python functions, not entire applications, and not parts of functions.  Numba does not replace your Python interpreter, but is just another Python module that can turn a function into a (usually) faster function. \n",
    " * **type-specializing**: Numba speeds up your function by generating a specialized implementation for the specific data types you are using.  Python functions are designed to operate on generic data types, which makes them very flexible, but also very slow.  In practice, you only will call a function with a small number of argument types, so Numba will generate a fast implementation for each set of types.\n",
    " * **just-in-time**: Numba translates functions when they are first called.  This ensures the compiler knows what argument types you will be using.  This also allows Numba to be used interactively in a Jupyter notebook just as easily as a traditional application.\n",
    " * **numerically-focused**: Currently, Numba is focused on numerical data types, like `int`, `float`, and `complex`.  There is very limited string processing support, and many string use cases are not going to work well on the GPU.  To get best results with Numba, you will likely be using NumPy arrays."

    "Note that Numba's type names tend to mirror [the NumPy type names](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.types.html), so a Python `float` is a `float64` (also called \"double precision\" in other languages).  Taking a look at the data types can sometimes be important in GPU code because the performance of `float32` and `float64` computations can (depending on the GPU) be very different on CUDA devices. If your algorithm can obtain correct results using `float32`, then you should probably use that data type, because casting to `float64` can, depending on the GPU type, dramatically slow down the function."

    "Wow, the GPU is *a lot slower* than the CPU?? For the time being this is to be expected because we have (deliberately) misused the GPU in several ways in this example. How we have misused the GPU will help clarify what kinds of problems are well-suited for GPU computing, and which are best left to be performed on the CPU:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Our inputs are too small**: the GPU achieves performance through parallelism, operating on thousands of values at once.  Our test inputs have only 4 and 16 integers, respectively.  We need a much larger array to even keep the GPU busy.\n",
    "  * **Our calculation is too simple**: Sending a calculation to the GPU involves quite a bit of overhead compared to calling a function on the CPU.  If our calculation does not involve enough math operations (often called \"arithmetic intensity\"), then the GPU will spend most of its time waiting for data to move around.\n",
    "  * **We copy the data to and from the GPU**: While in some scenarios, paying the cost of copying data to and from the GPU can be worth it for a single function, often it will be preferred to to run several GPU operations in sequence. In those cases, it makes sense to send data to the GPU and keep it there until all of our processing is complete.\n",
    "  * **Our data types are larger than necessary**: Our example uses `int64` when we probably don't need it.  Scalar code using data types that are 32 and 64-bit run basically the same speed on the CPU, and for integer types the difference may not be drastic, but 64-bit floating point data types may have a significant performance cost on the GPU, depending on the GPU type.  Basic arithmetic on 64-bit floats can be anywhere from 2x (Pascal-architecture Tesla) to 24x (Maxwell-architecture GeForce) slower than 32-bit floats. If you are using more modern GPUs (Volta, Turing, Ampere), then this could be far less of a concern.  NumPy defaults to 64-bit data types when creating arrays, so it is important to set the [`dtype`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/arrays.dtypes.html) attribute or use the [`ndarray.astype()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) method to pick 32-bit types when you need them.\n",

    "**Please note:** Not all NumPy code will work on the GPU, and, as in the following example, we will need to use the `math` library's `pi` and `exp` instead of NumPy's. Please see [the Numba docs](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/reference/numpysupported.html) for extensive coverage of NumPy support on the GPU."

As a convenience, Numba has been automatically transferring this data to the GPU for us so that it can be operated on by the GPU.

    "Generalized ufuncs are a little more tricky because they need a *signature* (not to be confused with the Numba type signature) that shows the index ordering when dealing with multiple inputs.  Fully explaining \"gufunc\" signatures is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can learn more from:\n",

    "Let's write our own normalization function.  This will take an array input and compute the L2 norm along the last dimension.  Generalized ufuncs take their output array as the last argument, rather than returning a value. If the output is a scalar, then we will still receive an array that is one dimension less than the array input. For example, computing the row sums of an array will return a 1 dimensional array for 2D array input, or 2D array for 3D array input."
